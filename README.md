# GridSystem-GSyCS
GS &amp; CS (GridSystem and Components Styles) is a grid system similar to Bootstrap, which allows you to organize the content of your website so that it can be adapted to different devices.

This system of grids and style for components was developed for a university course. If you want to collaborate in this small project, Do it!
